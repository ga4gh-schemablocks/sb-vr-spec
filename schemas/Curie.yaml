      A string that refers to an object uniquely.  The lifetime and
      scope of an id is defined by the sender.

      VR does not impose any contraints on strings used as ids in
      messages. However, to maximize sharability of data, the VR
      Specification RECOMMENDS that implementations use [W3C Compact
      URI (CURIE)](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) syntax.

      String CURIEs are represented as `prefix`:`reference` (W3C
      terminology), but often referred to as `namespace`:`accession`
      or `namespace`:`local id` colloquially.

      The VR specification also RECOMMENDS that `prefix` be defined in
      identifiers.org.

      The `reference` component is an unconstrained string.

      A CURIE is a URI.  URIs may *locate* objects (i.e., specify
      where to retrieve them) or *name* objects conceptually.  VR uses
      CURIEs primarily as a naming mechanism.

      Implementations MAY provide CURIE resolution mechanisms for
      prefixes to make these objects locatable.

      Using internal ids in public messages is strongly discouraged.
